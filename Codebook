Process:
1. Install and load data.table and reshape2 package in order to retrieve data
2. Read X_test & y_test data
3. Read activity_labels - subsetting for second column only
4. Read features - subsetting for second column only
5. Read subject_test
6. Define which features are mean and standard deviation
7. Add feature names to x_test data
8. Limit x_test data to only mean and standard deviation
9. Add activity labels to y_test
10. Add Suject label to subject_test
11. Merge subject_test, y_test, x_test
12. Read X_train & y_train data
13. Read subject_train
14. Add feature names to x_train data
15. Limit x_train data to only mean and standard deviation
16. Add activity labels to y_train
17. Add Suject lable to subject_train
18. Merge subject_train, y_train, x_train
19. Merge test and train data
20. Melt merged_data 
21. Apply mean function and create tidy_data set
22. Write tidy data file

Variables:
x_test - data.frame built from X_test.txt
y_test - data.frame built from y_test.txt
activity_labels - data.frame built from activity_labels.txt# 
features - data.frame built from features.txt
subject_test - data.frame built from subject_test.txt
extract_features - vector that identifies feature labels that contain "mean" or "std"
test_data - data.frame created from merging x_test, y_test, and subject_test (only including "mean" and "std" columns)
x_train - data.frame built from X_train.txt
y_train - data.frame built from y_train.txt
subject_train - data.frame built from subject_train.txt
training_data - data.frame created from merging x_train, y_train, and subject_train (only including "mean" and "std" columns)
merged_data - data.frame created by merging test_data and training_data
mergemelt - data.frame created by "melting" merged_data by Subject, Activity_ID and Activity Label, with variable column for all "mean" and "std" columns

Output:
tidy_data.txt - data.frame that is final output of exercise: 81 cols x 181 rows. All "std" and "mean" variables broken down by Subject and Activity
